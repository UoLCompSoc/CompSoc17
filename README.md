##### BUILDING

* Thanks to the lack of frameworks it couldn't be easier to build, simply download the files and launch index.php
* To take advantage of Facebook integration you'll need a page access token, this will be stored in data/access_token.txt
* Built with HTML, CSS, and JS with an easy to use template system written in PHP

#### IDEOLOGY


* Built for the modern web
* Don't be afraid to take advantage of new web technologies (eg Grid, Variables and Calculations)
* Scales across a wide range of devices (eg phones, tablets and desktops)

##### CONTRIBUTING

* Feel free to contribute and propose new changes
